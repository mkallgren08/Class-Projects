DATA PERSISTENCE
-----------------------------

2 Ways:
	1) Store data on client
	2) Store data on server

Do not put secure/sensitive info in local, session, or cookie storage.

local storage - client based, on the page only

session storage - client based, available if the browser is open (so you can 
tab away, but the info is there when you come back).

cookies are like membership cards at stores - they help link your history together
