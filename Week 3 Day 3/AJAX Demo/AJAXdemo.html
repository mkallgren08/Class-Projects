		$.ajax({

			method: "GET",
		}).done(function(response){
			// This called a callback function, specifically a function that runs when AJAX is DONE with its query.
			// Since the API returns a JSON Object, you can specify categories you want to return as you would in objects.
			// Ex: for the Actors:, it would be console.log(response.Actors)
			console.log(response);
		}).fail(function(){
			// This runs if you have no wifi or the site is inaccessible
			console.log("Ruh roh!");
		});
		// Now this code will run first, even though sequentially it's at the end! the reason is: 
		// The ajaz callback function doesn't run until the ebpage is DONE running.
		// This is an example of asynchronous code!
		console.log("Something happened")
