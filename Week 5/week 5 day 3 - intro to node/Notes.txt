Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform Javascript runtime environment
designed to be run outside of browsers.

It's a general utility that can be used for a variety of purposes including 
asset compilation, scripting, monitoring, and *most notably as the basis for 
web servers*


Why use Node.js?

- it re-uses javascript
- it's easily extendable: tons of plugins exist to expand capabilities
- fast-implementation: can create a whole server using only a few liness of code
- single-threaded Asynchronous Model - meaning it can handle multiple requests 
  simultaneously and not get bottlenecked.
