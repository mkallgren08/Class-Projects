for the request function's returned body:

console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));

This will return a version that humans can read easily and readily!

The null function adds a break at certain points in the code and indents 
on different lines'

console.log(JSON.stringify(result);

This will return a minified version that a computer (i.e. database) can
read just fine, but would be a nightmare for humans to read.
